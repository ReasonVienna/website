### Intro

The project uses create-react-app with [reason-scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts)

### Ideas for future TODOs

* Decode Json using https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-json
* Boilerplate for all ReasonML meetups (other countries)
* Profile pages for speakers/participants (way to share Code or Talks) - people can PR their profiles into the project
* Fetch YouTube and Meetup data into the page
* Links to all world-wide ReasonML meetups
